  <!-- VALUE PROPS / PROBLEM -->
  <section>
    <h2>Your team is maxed out. Your ideas aren't.</h2>
    <p>Great product ideas die on the backlog. Good MVPs stay scrappy too long. Your core team is shipping the roadmap, but there's critical work that can't wait:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Features worth testing before you commit engineering resources</li>
      <li>A scrappy V1 that needs professional polish to scale or fundraise</li>
      <li>Product experiments that don't fit in the sprint but can't wait months</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>You need a parallel team that validates ideas without derailing your roadmap.</strong></p>

    <h2>AI-Augmented Design & Prototyping Services</h2>
    <p>We combine strategic product thinking with AI-powered development to deliver in weeks, not months.</p>
    
    <!-- Tab: Rapid Prototyping -->
    <div>
      <h3>AI-Powered Rapid Prototyping</h3>
      <span>3-6 weeks | $8k-$15k</span>
      <p>Validate product ideas with working coded prototypes—faster than Lovable, Bolt, or v0 alone, with strategic thinking AI can't provide.</p>
      
      <h4>Perfect for:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Testing AI features or new product directions with real users</li>
        <li>Building investor-ready demos that close funding rounds</li>
        <li>Exploring adjacent products outside your core roadmap</li>
        <li>De-risking product bets before allocating engineering teams</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>What you get:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Strategic product session (what are we testing? what validates success?)</li>
        <li>Production-ready React/TypeScript prototype</li>
        <li>User-testable with realistic interactions and working data</li>
        <li>AI-accelerated development using Cursor, Claude, and v0</li>
        <li>Clean code documentation your team can build from</li>
        <li>Iteration cycles based on user feedback</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Our AI-augmented process:</h4>
      <p><strong>Week 1 – Discovery & Strategy:</strong> 90-minute strategy session to shape fuzzy ideas into testable hypotheses. What validates or kills this concept?</p>
      <p><strong>Weeks 2-4 – Build & Deliver:</strong> We use AI tools (Cursor, Claude, v0) to build 3-5x faster than traditional agencies—but bring strategic thinking and craft AI tools can't match.</p>
      <p><strong>Weeks 4-6 – Test & Refine:</strong> You test with real users. We iterate based on learnings.</p>
      <p><strong>Handoff:</strong> Clean code, documentation, and strategic recommendations on whether to build, pivot, or kill the idea.</p>
      
      <button>Start a Prototype Sprint</button>
      
      <h4>Why not just use Lovable or v0?</h4>
      <p>AI prototyping tools like Lovable, Bolt, and v0 are great for executing clear specs. But they can't help you figure out <em>what</em> to build. We bring strategic product thinking, opinionated design decisions for your market, and prototypes polished enough for investor pitches and user testing—not the generic "AI look" that screams demo.</p>

  <!-- WHY OFFSHOOT -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why Offshoot Studio</h2>
    
    <article>
      <h3>Strategic Product Thinking First</h3>
      <p>We help you figure out <em>what</em> to build, not just execute what you ask for. Every engagement starts with strategy—not Figma, not code. We ask hard questions about what success looks like, what you're actually testing, and what the minimum version is that gives you real signal.</p>
      <p>We're not an execution shop that takes a brief and disappears. If the brief is wrong, we'll tell you.</p>
    </article>
    
    <article>
      <h3>AI-Augmented Speed</h3>
      <p>We use Cursor, Claude, v0, and other AI development tools to build 3-5x faster than traditional design agencies. But AI doesn't know your market, your users, or when an interaction feels wrong. We do.</p>
      <p>We're not a "prompt-and-ship" operation. AI is how we move fast. Strategic judgment is how we get it right.</p>
    </article>
    
    <article>
      <h3>Design + Engineering in One Person</h3>
      <p>No handoff lag, no translation loss, no coordination overhead. When design and engineering live in the same person, things that usually break don't—edge cases get caught early, interactions get refined in code, and what you see in the prototype is exactly what your team builds from.</p>
      <p>We're not a designer who throws Figma files over the wall. We're not an engineer who needs pixel-perfect specs. We're both, which means nothing falls through the gap.</p>

  <!-- FAQ (id="faq") -->
  <section id="faq">
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>How is this different from hiring an AI designer or using Lovable?</dt>
      <dd>AI tools like Lovable, Bolt, and v0 are excellent for executing clear specs quickly. But they can't help you figure out what to build, make strategic product decisions, or deliver the polish that closes enterprise deals. We use those same AI tools to build faster—but bring 10+ years of strategic product thinking, opinionated design for your market, and production-quality code your team can ship. Think of it as "AI-augmented design engineering" rather than pure AI generation.</dd>
      
      <dt>How is this different from a traditional design agency?</dt>
      <dd>Design agencies have account managers, project managers, junior designers, and bloated processes that slow everything down. You get one senior design engineer who can think strategically and execute fast—using AI tools to move 3-5x faster than traditional agencies. No bureaucracy. No handoff lag between design and engineering.</dd>
      
      <dt>How is this different from hiring a full-time designer or engineer?</dt>
      <dd>Hiring takes 2-3 months and comes with $150k+ salary, benefits, payroll overhead, and employment risk. We start in 2-3 weeks, cost a fraction of a senior hire, and work on defined project scopes. Perfect for validating ideas, temporary capacity needs, or projects with clear timelines—without long-term employment commitment.</dd>
      
      <dt>Do you only do AI prototyping, or can you build production features?</dt>
      <dd>We do both. Rapid prototyping sprints validate ideas before your team commits resources. Embedded design engineering means we join your team for 3-6 months to ship production features. All our code is production-ready—whether it's a prototype or a shipped feature.</dd>
      
      <dt>What if I need you for longer than the initial engagement?</dt>
      <dd>Many clients work with us on multiple projects over time—rapid prototyping one quarter, embedded engineering the next, design refinement after a fundraise. We can extend engagements or start new ones as your needs evolve.</dd>
      
      <dt>Do you work with early-stage startups or only Series A+?</dt>
      <dd>We focus on Series A+ companies and established teams with product-market fit. If you're pre-seed or seed stage, our pricing ($8k-$15k per engagement) might not fit your budget yet. Happy to recommend other resources for earlier-stage companies.</dd>
      
      <dt>What's your availability and typical lead time?</dt>
      <dd>We take on 2-3 projects per quarter. Typical lead time to start a new engagement is 2-3 weeks. For urgent projects or embedded work, we can sometimes start sooner.</dd>
      
      <dt>What industries and types of products do you work on?</dt>
      <dd>We're industry-agnostic but primarily work with B2B SaaS, fintech, developer tools, and AI products. If your product involves complex workflows, data visualization, technical users, or AI features—we're a great fit. We don't do consumer social apps, e-commerce, or marketing websites.</dd>
      
      <dt>How do we get started?</dt>
      <dd>Book a 30-minute strategy call below. We'll discuss your needs (rapid prototyping, embedded work, or design refinement), see if there's mutual fit, and scope what makes sense for your timeline and budget. No sales pitch—just an honest conversation.</dd>
